# Software & System Design Implementation with Go

Welcome to my learning journey repository! This repository is dedicated to my process of learning **backend development** using **Go (Golang)** programming language, as well as implementing various **system design** theories.

## üéØ Purpose & Motivation

This repository focuses on two primary areas:

1.  **Mastering Golang:** Learning the ins and outs of Go, from fundamental concepts like goroutines and channels to using its ecosystem of frameworks and libraries to build efficient services.
2.  **System Design Implementation:** Translating theoretical system design concepts‚Äîsuch as Clean Architecture, Message Queues, and Caching‚Äîinto practical, working code.

The repository here serve as my playground to experiment and understand how each architectural component works before integrating them into more complex systems.

## ‚ú® Practical Implementation: Mood Bridge V2

As a tangible application of the concepts learned here, I have implemented the **Clean Architecture** pattern in another project. This architecture helps in decoupling business logic from technical details, making the application easier to maintain, test, and scale.

You can view the implementation in the following repository:

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository contains a collection of projects and notes, each housed in its own directory. You will find two main types of content:

1.  **Practical Go Projects**: Directories like `clean-architecture-go` and `kafka-franz-go` contain hands-on implementations of specific technologies and architectural patterns. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates a concept I am currently learning.

2.  **System Design Notes**: The `system-design-resources` directory holds my consolidated notes on various theoretical topics, from caching and load balancing to database scaling. These notes serve as the theoretical foundation for the practical projects.

Feel free to explore each directory to see my progress in specific areas of backend development and system design.
